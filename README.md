# NexCharacters

**How its work?**
First, we will present the 'Switch' status to each player. With this, NexCore will be in charge of managing the progression status of each player, asking if they are in play, in the menu or making a transition between one of the two.

Do not be scared, all this is automatic, it is just so that you know  how it works.

**NexCharacters is the graphical interface for creating and deleting characters.**

## Code
We know that the beauty of the code could be better, so we invite you to improve it.

Our system has some complexities, since this adaptation was for private use, our systems are made for certain resources with which we will release with NexCore.

If you have user records and then activate some option to use the extension, you will have to manually create the missing records for each player, however, it is likely that each system integrates an automatic method.

## Translation 
There is a file `ui_es.html` if you want it to go back to Spanish, just rename it to `ui.html`

## Modifications

Yes, it is totally modifiable to your liking and I beg you not to discriminate by the designs, I did not have a decent graphic developer, this have a simple desing but its work.

You can modify the graphical interface (`index.html & app.js`) you must send any new design to be delivered to our Discord so that other people can use it as well.
